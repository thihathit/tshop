Build a REST API nodejs server for T-shirt. Only give me the codes. No explanation required.

The server should have the following endpoints for users to interact with the server.:
- /product/list?name=&color=&size=&price=
- /product/:id
- /cart/add
- /cart/remove
- /cart/update
- /cart/list
- /cart/checkout
Server Setup:
- Endpoint spec must be exported to OpenAPI 3.0 format.(serve at /api-spec.yaml)
- Choose api endpoint input validator or a nodejs framework that plays well with OpenAPI export mechanism.
- /api-spec.yaml must have a global desciption of what this serprver does and what features it supports in natural language.
- There must be Swagger UI to visualize and interact with the API. (serve at /api-docs)
- Consider honojs / fastify frameworks if applicable, if not go with whatever u see fit.
- Use a in-memory data store to store the data.
- Use mock data to populate the data store upon server start. Use mock generation library for this. Must have at least 100 products.
Feature Note:
- product's stock must reflect the cart's state.
- product & cart list need to support offset-based pagination.
- Make sure the cart state is global and shared among all users.
- /api-spec.yaml should be generated based on the endpoint's configurations not the other way around
